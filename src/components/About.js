                            My name is Keren, and I’m a front-end developer, curious dabbler, 
                            and an aspiring fit person. &#x1F3C3; I’m passionate about 
                            leveraging technology as a tool to create meaningful experiences 
                            that empower others. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Currently at Northwestern University, I will be graduating in June 
                            2020 with a degree in Computer Science with the Segal Design Certificate, 
                            and I’m looking forward to moving to Seattle to work as a software 
                            developer after I graduate. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My eventual goal is to work as a front-end developer or UX engineer 
                            in the healthcare or education tech industry—two fields where I see 
                            myself doing the most purpose-driven work. 
                        </p>
